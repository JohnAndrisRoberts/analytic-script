PROJECT: Analytic Solver for Thin Film Photovoltaics
PROJECT PET NAME: Every Love Story is a Ghost Story
AUTHOR: Zane Rossi with thinFilm.py based in code by John Roberts
INSTIUTION: University of Chicago, PGS Lab, 2016.

#######################################
## PRIMARY USES & SUMMARY: 
* Contents of this project may be used in tandem to
  optimize thin film configurations as well as plot
  their internal characteristics, including explicit
  and average e-fields, transmission and reflection
  coefficients, and e-field integrals across structures
  or particular features.
* File 'thinFilmClean.py' contains all methods relating
  to analytic thin film solver, using methods defined in
  various photonics papers indicated in code. This file
  may be called explicitly to plot various collections of
  films defined in head of code ('stack'). This 'stack'
  is easily adjustable, with measurements in nm, and
  directions for input of refractive indices, allowing
  constant real, constant complex, csv-format, and Drude
  Model indices.
* File 'autoOptimize.py' calls various methods in the
  aforementioned file, but does not utilize stack defined
  in the file at that time (if such a stack exists). Rather
  autoOptimize defines its own stack with auxiliary
  parameters for minimum, maximum, and smallest  discrete
  step possible to fabricate for each layer. This stack
  is modified quietly by the code (specifically in method
  evaluateCells, to be readable by thinFilm methods. Code
  uses heuristic to populate space defined as n-dimensional
  discrete space consisting of all possible layer thick-
  nesses. This space, often very large, is seeded and 
  searched so that optimal or near optimal configuration
  can often be found through population of only 0.05% of
  entire space. Details of this optimization, and its
  standard and advances use are defined below.
  autoOptimize does not use thinFilm.py graphic methods
  currently, but optimal stacks may be either ported 
  by hand, or auxiliary call.
* file 'paramVary.py' is deprecated.
* auxiliary files contain refraction index information,
  or notes on code performance and routes for improvement.

## THINFILM METHODS:

  ### main:
    * options to save, as well as plot various characteristics
      of device, clearly named and labeled
    * various alterable constants are defined, with their uses
      and dimensions defined in code. these will not
      need to be altered often if one is testing differing
      configurations under same external conditions
        *  wls is simply list of linspace of wavelengths (in nm)
           to be tested over. Average plots will average equally over all
           specified wavelengths with equal weight. Blackbody radiation
           may be turned on with given maximum wavelength in code preamble.
           be aware these results are not directly commensurable with non
           blackbody results, as overall scale is arbitrary.
        *  angles is a non weighted list in radians
    * fundamental constants are defined
    * main stack is defined, comprising layers, each a film
      data type defined early in code (a named tuple). A stack
      is simply a list of films, and only one stack may currently
      be run at a time (although alterations to code would not
      make the sequential run of stacks difficult. Film options are:
        * 'layer' : generic name of layer, do not worry about this.
        * 'depth' : depth in nm of said layer, integer or float.
        * 'index' : index of refraction, either constant, name of external file
                    or Drude parameters defined earlier in code (currently only
                    valid for ITO. 
        * 'name'  : unique name for layer, for display and reference purposes.
                    That is, element of named tuple may be referenced by index 
                    or name of field, in this case 'name.'
        * 'active': determines whether this layer's individual e-field wil be 
                    integrated, and thus plotted or otherwise displayed. leave
                    boolean True if this is desired.
    * rest of methods need not be altered, and result is deterministic
      based on parameters supplied above. These methods simply call the
      appropriate helper methods to do dirty work in traversing your
      specified structure.

## AUTOOPTIMIZE METHODS:

  ### main:
    * easily adjustable constants are defined
      * MAX_STEP: number of propagations desired (similar to iterations 
        of flood fill, save with accompanying heuristic that allows non linear
        scaling)
      * ACTIVE_LAYER: index of layer in stack, defined in autoOptimize.py, that
        one wishes to maximize the e-field integral over. Currently this is 
        implemented for one active layer only, although this can be changed
        with relative ease in accompanying methods (namely, evaluate Cells)
      * DIVISIONS: seeds space with (DIVISIONS + 1) active cells evenly spaced
        along each dimension of the search space, taking the cartesian product
        of these one dimensional intervals, and thus seeding a lattice. Higher
        value increases search time per propagation, but give shorter path to
        possible optima
    * search space is then instantiated to proper size according to stack, and
      values specified above.
    * code propagates either MAX_STEP times, or until there are no active cells
      (if you feel you are running low on active cells too soon, see 
      selectedNeighbors subsection of propagate method). Output is list of best
      cells per propagation, listing coordinates first, and then fitness of
      said cell. Final output give numerical information on traversal of space.

  ### propagate:
    * this is the workhorse method of the heuristic search algorithm. all
      methods called via this method (save evaluate Cells) will be described
      in short for now, and given full entries later. They will not in standard
      cases need alteration, serving primarily as helpers.
    * INPUT: 
      * currentState: numpy array containing all information on unvisited (0)
        cells, visited but inactive (1) cells, and visited active (2) cells.
        Dimension of array is length of stack, and is automatically generated
        in main. Solely an integer array. 
      * activeCells : list of tuples denoting coordinates of all cells in
        currentState with value 2. Dimension is same as n discussed above.
      * fitnessMap  : list of tuples. Each tuple contains two (2) elements,
        namely a tuple and a float. This interior tuple is a coordinate of the
        same form populating activeCells. Float is accompanying fitness of
        cell. All heuristic decisions are made off this data structure.
      * optimum     : single element of fitnessMap, largest float parameter.
    * propagate makes copies of its inputs, and should NEVER modify them. when
      modifying propagate, two main section should be accessed first, forming
      the core of the heuristic:
        * selectedCells    : those cells which are chosen to determine the
          fitness of some of their neighbors. these cells are chosen from the
          current active cells. Note, even if cells are not chosen to be within
          selectedCells, they should REMAIN active for possible future use. 
          currently, the algorithm is set to select varying percentages of the
          active cells based on fitness alone. This selection criteria can be
          modified as seen fit.
        * selectedNeighbors: those cells which are traveled to from above
          selectedCells. Currently the code chooses which direction to travel
          based on barycentric methods and threshold values. Note, ALWAYS check
          hasTraversed of cell before propagating to it. This incorporates both
          boundaries and previously traversed cells. The code will throw errors
          if you do not, and you will lament your previous blas√© existence.
          Currently, simply modifying how properDim is selected is an easy path
          for modifying the heuristic.
            - properDim is boolean n-element array detailing which of the n
              dimensions are optimal to propagate towards
            - signDim is an integer n-element array indicating whether forward
              backward, or both in specified optimal dimension should be chosen
        * Varying these two modes of selection, a majority of heuristic
          alterations can be comfortably made. If you choose to go beyond these
          methods, be aware of variable mutation, checking cell validity, and
          maintaining active cells not otherwise being accessed. Future room
          for modifications centers in better maintenance of active cells.
    * RETURN:
      * tuple comprising newState, newActive, and newOptimum.
      * these are modified COPIES of original input, allowing for sequential
        feeding of method's output into itself. See INPUT for data types.

  ### evaluateCells:
    * this is the workhorse method for porting into thinFilmClean.py in order
      to fill fitnessMap. all extra-file communication should be contained in
      this method (promise me).
    * INPUT: 
      * activeCells: defined above.
      * activeLayer: layer in stack by zero index whose value is to be somehow
        manipulated by evaluateCells to be largest if said coordinate is deemed
        optimal.
    * evaluateCells calls on elements in stack to create a new list of films
      compatible with the portFilm data type defined in the preamble. This data
      type corresponds to the film data type of thinFilmClean.py. This new
      stack is then ported through thinFilmClean.py methods to return requisite
      integral for e-field in activeLayer (current setup for optimization).
      If one for example wished to minimize transmission, one could feed some
      monotone decreasing function of transmission into the second element of
      the tuples then fed into fitnessMap.
    * OUTPUT:
      * fitnessMap: defined above.

  ### prettyPrint:
    * INPUT:
      * currentState: defined above.
      * dim1, dim2: integers detailing slicing dimensions. They should be
        DIFFERENT, and between 0 and n - 1 inclusive for n-layer stack.
    * for quick debugging of the heuristic, this allows the display of the
      dim1-dim2 plane with 0 -> " ", 1 -> ".", 2 -> "#". When space is taken
      to be two dimensional (e.g. all but two layers of stack are given set
      measurement), this allows visualization of whole space and activity of 
      heuristic in traversal. Method stands on its own due to clumsiness of
      slicing ndarray data type.
    * OUTPUT: IO, prints to terminal.
