Things to be Addressed:

(1) Weighting of incident radiation wavelength according to blackbody et al. spectra.

(2) Automated optimization - use of cluster computing to continually adjust layer parameters under some decently intelligent heuristic

(3) Incorporating multiple angles of incidence (possibly weighted) and verifying proper results. Accounting for total internal reflection as well as extension of Snell's law to complex indices of refraction (there are methods available that are valid in the small-conductivity limit, but beyond that it seems as if people are having little luck).
